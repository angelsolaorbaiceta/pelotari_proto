# Pelotari Protocol

A protocol to discover computers connected inside the same private network built on top of UDP.
It allows to find other computers, register them as peers, send and receive messages from them.
The protocol doesn't guarantee delivery of UDP messages; it's a fire a forget protocol.

A pelotari is someone who plays [basque pelota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_pelota).
The protocol analogy is a pelotari looking for peers to play pelota, asking around in its neighbourhood (the private network).

The protocol is implemented as a Go library: **prototari** (protocol pelotari).
